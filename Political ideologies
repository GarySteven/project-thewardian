Political philosophies are all attempts to answer the same or similar questions. I think these can be
summed up, crudely it's true, in the question: 'How can and should we live together, since live
together we must?'

The answers vary according to conceptions of human nature and assumptions about human goals or
primary values. If human nature exists, what is it? And what good or goods should a society pursue
or protect? Although we tend to taxonomise, within our categories we find oppositions, polarities
and continua:

atomised individuals vs. interdependent humans
Free will vs. determinism
Idealism vs. materialism
Abstract equality vs. satisfying needs
Decay vs. progress
Ahistoricism vs. utopianism
Flawed humanity vs. perfectible humanity
Rational individuals vs. emotional individuals
Contractualism/consent vs. power
Functionalism vs. conflict model
Freedom as choice vs. freedom as fulfilment
